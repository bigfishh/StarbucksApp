    Has issue connecting with Starbucks id.
    
    Had issue connecting the user id. First tried to use self.id which wouldnt work bc self is still Starbucks App 
    and not the user instance, in the end for the time being using User.all.last.id however (to read the most recent user)
    will only work if your signing up for the app, for a login youll need to access the actual user. 

  Order proccesing with animation of waiting or dancing emoji/computer
